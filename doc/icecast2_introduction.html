<h2>What is Icecast ?</h2>
<p>Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg Vorbis and MP3 audio streams.  It can be used to create an Internet radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in between.  It is very versatile in that new formats can be added relatively easily and supports open standards for commuincation and interaction.</p>
<br>
<p>There are two major parts to most streaming media servers: the component providing the content (what we call <b>source clients</b>) and the component which is responsible for serving that content to listeners (this is the function of icecast).
