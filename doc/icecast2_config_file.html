    &lt;/limits&gt;
</pre>
<p>This section contains server level settings that, in general, do not need to be changed.  Only modify this section if you are know what you are doing.
</p>
<h4>clients</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Total number of concurrent clients supported by the server.  Listeners are considered clients, but so is accesses to any static content (i.e. fileserved content) and also any requests to gather stats.  These are max *concurrent* connections for the entire server (not per mountpoint).
</div>
<h4>sources</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Maximum number of connected sources supported by the server.
</div>
<h4>threadpool</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This is the number of threads that are started to handle client connections.  You may need to increase this value if you are running a high traffic stream.  This recommended value is for a small to medium traffic server.
</div>
<h4>queue-size</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This is the maximum size (in bytes) of a client (listener) queue.  A listener may temporarily lag behind due to network congestion and in this case an internal queue is maintained for each listener.  If the queue grows larger than this config value, then the listener will be removed from the stream.
</div>
<h4>client-timeout</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This does not seem to be used.
</div>
<h4>header-timeout</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a request to come in once the client has made a connection to the server.  In general this value should not need to be tweaked.
</div>
<h4>source-timeout</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
If a connected source does not send any data within this timeout period (in seconds), then the source connection will be removed from the server.
</div>
<h4>burst-on-connect</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
With this enabled, a connecting client will be sent a burst of audio data from the stream.  This will have the effect of reducing the startup time for the stream from the perspective of the listener.  This is due to the fact that most media players have local buffers that must be filled before the stream begins to play.  This may introduce a small latency in the stream (difference in time between when the source plays a clip and the listener hears a clip).  If this latency is important to you, then you can disable this feature.  The latency is bitrate-dependent, but as an example, for a 128kbps stream, the latency between the source and the player is ~ 1.5 secs WITHOUT burst on connect, and WITH burst on connect the latency is 3 secs.
</div>
<h4>burst-size</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
The burst size is the amount of data (in bytes) to burst to a client at connection time. Like
burst-on-connect, this is to quickly fill the pre-buffer used by media players. The default
is 64kbytes which is a typical size used by most clients so changing it is not usually required.
This setting applies to all mountpoints.

<h2>Misc Server Settings</h2>
<pre>
    &lt;hostname&gt;localhost&lt;hostname&gt;

    &lt;-- You can use these two if you only want a single listening socket --&gt;
    &lt;-- &lt;port&gt;8000&lt;/port&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;-- &lt;bind-address&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/bind-address&gt; --&gt;

    &lt;-- You may have multiple &lt;listen-socket&gt; elements --&gt;
    &lt;listen-socket&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;8000&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;bind-address&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/bind-address&gt;
    &lt;/listen-socket&gt;
    &lt;listen-socket&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;8001&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;bind-address&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/bind-address&gt;
        &lt;shoutcast-compat&gt;1&lt;/shoutcast-compat&gt;
    &lt;/listen-socket&gt;

    &lt;fileserve&gt;1&lt;/fileserve&gt;
    &lt;shoutcast-mount&gt;/live.nsv&lt;/shoutcast-mount&gt;
</pre>
<p>This section contains miscellaneous server settings.  Note that multiple listen-socket sections may be configured in order to have icecast2 listen on multiple network interfaces.  If a bind-address is not specified for a particular listen-socket, then the socket will be bound to all interfaces. Generally, you won't need to set bind-address.
</p>
<h4>port</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
The TCP port that will be used to accept client connections.
</div>
<h4>bind-address</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
An optional IP address that can be used to bind to a specific network card.  If not supplied, then it will bind to all interfaces.
</div>
<h4>shoutcast-compat</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This optional flag will indicate that this port will operate in 'shoutcast-compatibility' mode.  Due to major differences in the source client connection protocol, if you wish to use any of the shoutcast DJ tools, you will need to configure at least one socket as shoutcast-compatible.  Note that when in this mode, only source clients (and specifically shoutcast source clients) will be able to attach to this port.  All listeners may connect to any of the ports defined without this flag.  Also, for proper Shoutcast DSP compatibility, you must define a listen socket with a port one less than the one defined as 'shoutcast-compat'.  This means if you define 8001 as shoutcast-compat, then you will need to define a listen port of 8000 and it must not also be defined as shoutcast-compat.  See the example config file in the distribution for more info.
</div>
<h4>fileserve</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This flag turns on the icecast2 fileserver from which static files can be served.  All files are served relative to the path specified in the &lt;paths&gt;&lt;webroot&gt; configuration setting.
</div>
<h4>shoutcast-mount</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
An optional mountpoint to use when shoutcast DSP compatible clients connect. The default is /stream but can
be overridden here to use an alternative name which may include an extension that some clients require for
certain formats.
</div>

    &lt;/relay&gt;
</pre>
<p>This section contains the server's relay settings. There are two types of relays: a "Master server relay" or a "Specific Mountpoint relay."  A Master server relay is only supported between icecast2 servers and is used to relays all mountpoints on a remote icecast2 server.   
</p>
<h3>Master Relay</h3>
<p>
The following diagram shows the basics of doing a Master relay.  Note that Server 1 is configured with the &lt;master-server&gt;, &lt;master-server-port&gt;, etc settings and Server 2 is the server from which Server 1 will pull all attached mountpoints and relay them.  Using a Master Server relay, ALL mountpoints on Server 2 will be relayed.  If only specific mountpoints need to be relayed, then you must configure Server 1 as a "Specific Mountpoint Relay".  Both Master server relays and Specific Mountpoint relays begin their "relaying" when the Server is started.
</p>

     configured with
     &lt;master-server&gt;
     settings 

</pre>
<p>
A server is configured as a Master Server relay by specifying the &lt;master-server&gt;, &lt;master-server-port&gt;,&lt;master-update-interval&gt;,&lt;master-password&gt; values in the config file.  The server that is being relayed does not need any special configuration.
</p>

<h4>master-server</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This is the IP for the server which contains the mountpoints to be relayed (Master Server).  
</div>
<h4>master-server-port</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This is the TCP Port for the server which contains the mountpoints to be relayed (Master Server).
</div>
<h4>master-update-interval</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
The interval (in seconds) that the Relay Server will poll the Master Server for any new mountpoints to relay.
</div>
<h4>master-username</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This is the relay username on the master server.  It is used to query the
server for a list of mountpoints to relay. If not specified then 'relay' is
used
</div>
<h4>master-password</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This is the relay password on the Master server.  It is used to query the
server for a list of mountpoints to relay.
</div>
<br />
<h3>Specific Mountpoint Relay</h3>
The following diagram shows the basics of doing a Specific Mountpoint relay.  Note that Server 1 is configured with the &lt;relay&gt; settings and Server 2 is the server from which Server 1 will pull the specified mountpoint(s) and relay them.  Using a Specific Mountpoint Relay, only those mountpoints specified on Server 1 will be relayed from Server 2.

<pre>
      |-----|                       |-----|
      |     |      /mount3          |     | /mount1

      Server 1                      Server 2
      (RELAY SERVER)                (REMOTE SERVER)

     configured with
     &lt;relay&gt;
     settings 

</pre>

Specific Mountpoint Relays can be configured to relay from an Icecast 2 server, as well as Icecast 1.x and Shoutcast.
A server is configured as a Specific Mountpoint Server relay by specifying a &lt;relay&gt; XML chunk in the config file for each mountpoint to be relayed.  The server that is being relayed does not need any special configuration.

<pre>
    &lt;relay&gt;
        &lt;server&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;8001&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;mount&gt;/example.ogg&lt;/mount&gt;
        &lt;local-mount&gt;/different.ogg&lt;/local-mount&gt;

</pre>
<p>This section contains settings which apply only to a specific mountpoint.  Within this section you can reserve a specific mountpoint and set a source username/password for that mountpoint (not yet implemented) as well as specify individual settings which will apply only to the supplied mountpoint.
</p>
<h4>mount-name</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
The name of the mount point for which these settings apply.
</div>
<h4>username</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
An optional value which will set the username that a source must use to connect using this mountpoint.
</div>
<h4>password</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
An optional value which will set the password that a source must use to connect using this mountpoint.
</div>
<h4>max-listeners</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
An optional value which will set the maximum number of listeners that can be attached to this mountpoint.
</div>
<h4>dump-file</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
An optional value which will set the filename which will be a dump of the stream coming through on this mountpoint.
</div>
<h4>fallback-mount</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This optional value specifies a mountpoint that clients are automatically moved to if the source
shuts down or is not streaming at the time a listener connects.  Only one can be listed in each
mount and should refer to another mountpoint on the same server that is streaming in the same
streaming format.<br> 
If clients cannot fallback to another mountpoint, due to a missing fallback-mount or it states a
mountpoint that is just not available, then those clients will be disconnected.
If clients are falling back to a mountpoint and the fallback-mount is not actively streaming
but defines a fallback-mount itself then those clients may be moved there instead.
This multi-level fallback allows clients to cascade several mountpoints. 
</div>
<h4>fallback-override</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
When enabled, this allows a connecting source client or relay on this mountpoint to move
listening clients back from the fallback mount.
</div>
<h4>no-yp</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Setting this option prevents this mountpoint from advertising on YP.  The default is 0 so YP
advertising occurs however you may want to prevent it here if you intend listeners to connect
to a local relay instead
</div>
<h4>burst-size</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This optional setting allows for providing a burst size which overrides the default burst size
as defined in limits.  The value is in bytes.
</div>
<h4>mp3-metadata-interval</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This optional setting specifies what interval, in bytes, there is between metadata updates within
shoutcast compatible streams. This only applies to new listeners connecting on this mountpoint,
not existing listeners falling back to this mountpoint.  The default is either the hardcoded
server default or the value passed from a relay.
</div>
<h4>hidden</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Enable this to prevent this mount from being shown on the xsl pages.  This is mainly
for cases where a local relay is configured and you do not want the source of the local
relay to be shown
</div>
<h4>authentication</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This specifies that the named mount point will require listener authentication.  Currently, we only support a file-based authentication scheme (type=htpasswd).  Users and encrypted password are placed in this file (separated by a :) and all requests for this mountpoint will require that a user and password be supplied for authentication purposes.  These values are passed in via normal HTTP Basic Authentication means (i.e. http://user:password@stream:port/mountpoint.ogg).  Users and Passwords are maintained via the web admin interface.  A mountpoint configured with an authenticator will display a red key next to the mount point name on the admin screens.  You can read more about listener authentication <a href="icecast2_listenerauth.html">here</a>.

</pre>
<p>This section contains paths which are used for various things within icecast.  All paths should not end in a '/'.
</p>
<h4>basedir</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This path is used in conjunction with the chroot settings, and specified the base directory that is chrooted to when the server is started.  This feature is not supported on win32.
</div>
<h4>logdir</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This path specifies the base directory used for logging. Both the error.log and access.log will be created relative to this directory.  
</div>
<h4>pidfile</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This pathname specifies the file to write at startup and to remove at normal shutdown. The file contains the process id of the icecast process. This could be read and used for sending signals icecast.
</div>
<h4>webroot</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This path specifies the base directory used for all static file requests.  This directory can contain all standard file types (including mp3s and ogg vorbis files).  For example, if webroot is set to /var/share/icecast2, and a request for http://server:port/mp3/stuff.mp3 comes in, then the file /var/share/icecast2/mp3/stuff.mp3 will be served.
</div>
<h4>adminroot</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
This path specifies the base directory used for all admin requests.  More specifically, this is used to hold the XSLT scripts used for the web-based admin interface.  The admin directory contained within the icecast distribution contains these files.
</div>
<h4>alias source="/foo" dest="/bar"</h4>

    &lt;/logging&gt;
</pre>
<p>This section contains information relating to logging within icecast.  There are two logfiles currently generated by icecast, an error.log (where all log messages are placed) and an access.log (where all stream/admin/http requests are logged).
</p>
<p>Note that on non-win32 platforms, a HUP signal can be sent to icecast in which the log files are re-opened for appending giving the ability move/remove the log files.
</p>
<h4>accesslog</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Into this file, all requests made to the icecast2 will be logged.  This file is relative to the path specified by the &lt;logdir&gt; config value.
</div>
<h4>errorlog</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
All icecast generated log messages will be written to this file.  If the loglevel is set too high (Debug for instance) then this file can grow fairly large over time.  Currently, there is no log-rotation implemented.
</div>
<h4>playlistlog</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Into this file, a log of all metadata for each mountpoint will be written.  The format of the logfile will most likely change over time as we narrow in on a standard format for this.  Currently, the file is pipe delimited.  This option is optional and can be removed entirely from the config file.
</div>
<h4>loglevel</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
Indicates what messages are logged by icecast.  Log messages are categorized into one of 4 types, Debug, Info, Warn, and Error.<br /><br />The following mapping can be used to set the appropraite value :
<ul>
<li>loglevel = 4 - Debug, Info, Warn, Error messages are printed</li>
<li>loglevel = 3 - Info, Warn, Error messages are printed</li>
<li>loglevel = 2 - Warn, Error messages are printed</li>
<li>loglevel = 1 - Error messages only are printed</li>
</ul>
