icecast 2.x - README
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg 
Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet 
radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in 
between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added 
relatively easily and supports open standards for commuincation and 
interaction.


Prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------------------
icecast requires the following packages :

* libxml2 - http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html
* libxslt - http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html
* curl - http://curl.haxx.se/download.html (>= version 7.10 required)
  NOTE: icecast may be compiled without curl, however this will
        disable all Directory server interaction (YP).
* ogg/vorbis - http://www.vorbis.com/files (>= version 1.0 required)
