2004-11-11 15:47:33  Rev 8191   oddsock

	* :
	  * support for the Shoutcast DSP (yay!).
    You can now use the Shoutcast DSP as a source client.  The connection 
    protocol is a bit odd, and we had to handle it separately, and thus 
    we've added a new config option (<shoutcast-compat>) that is set at 
    the listener port level.
* support for NSV (and the nsvscsrc source client).
    After adding support for the connection protocol of the shoutcast DSP, 
    adding NSV was just a simple of a few special handling cases.
* removed all traces of the earlier attempt at the shoutcast DSP connection 
  protocol
* Due to the growing complexity of the config files, I've also created a 
  few alternate config files, namely one for a "shoutcast compat" setup
  as well as a "minimal" one for quick basic configurations.

correct. Patch from Dave St John.

make install now installs the xsl files in pkgdatadir ($prefix/share/icecast) web

installed in $sysconfdir/etc, and IMHO icecast should attempt to find a config
file there, and only demand one on the command line if it can't.

wrong (but due to the exact nature of the bug this wasn't causing any active

many clients will do auto-reconnect, so this may not be sufficient on its own,

	* src/util.c src/yp.h src/source.c src/util.h src/source.h src/yp.c:
	  added parsing of new icy-audio-info header which will be used to
communicate things like samplerate/quality/number of channels to
icecast2. This info will be then forwarded to the yp servers for
better stream info.

also factored out some logic in source_main into common functions

added a few new routines into util.c (taken from Brendan's
updates to libshout)

	  Better IPv6 support. Hopefully logging will work correctly now.
However, some things still won't work, notably relaying (the relay can be
ipv6, the server being relayed _from_ may not be).
I'll fix that some time soon.

	  Lots of fixes for screwy code formatting, plus:

make streams public by default, send ice-private: 1 to make them private.
However, default config file has yp servers commented out.

A little fix for compilation on some solaris systems

Redo some config file stuff: now all the passwords are inside an element
<authentication>, (though for now they're also accepted in the old location),
and added admin username and password. Move some of the admin activities over
to using the admin passwords (admin action that affect a mountpoint use the
source password)

Fill in some (but not yet all, maybe i'll do that later) of the infrastructure
for per-mountpoint passwords.

Fix lots of headers/code so that it works properly/portably  on non-win32
systems.

it would be triggered in certain cases, instead of merely making it dependant
on previous values written to the variable in those cases.

2002-04-05 16:33:35  Rev 3220   jack

	* src/stats.c:
	  Oddsock finally found the win32 crash bug.  _event_listeners wasn't being
initialized (the first time it was NULL).  After the server is restarted
it retained a pointer to freed memory.  We should have been initializing
this anyway.

	* src/format_vorbis.c src/format.h src/source.c:

done differently, feel free to change it (or ask me to).


2002-03-22 22:41:16  Rev 3178   jack

	* src/connection.c:
	  Ouch.  Serious bug found by Ricardo Galli.

When the cond var is signalled it will wake up a thread.  If all the
connection handler threads are handling connections, the signal will be
ignored and clients will 'pend' until another client causes the to signal
again.

We have to check to see if there are more pending connections before waiting
on the signal again.


2002-03-22 21:18:03  Rev 3175   jack

	* src/source.c:
	  We were triggering error logic when no errors had occurred.  Thanks

	* src/format_vorbis.c src/format.h src/connection.c src/source.c 
	  src/stats.h src/format.c:
	  Bunch of fixes:

 - connections are now matched to format plugins based on content-type headers,
   and are rejected if there isn't a format handler for that content-type, or
   there is no content-type at all.
 - format_vorbis now handles pages with granulepos of -1 in the headers
   correctly (this happens if the headers are fairly large, because of
   many comments, for example).
 - various #include fixes.
 - buffer overflow in httpp.c fixed.


2002-02-08 03:59:17  Rev 3034   jack

2002-02-06 06:11:03  Rev 3026   jack

	* src/stats.c src/stats.h:
	  A very slightly modified version of oddsocks function to support gui
stats updates.  Basically stats_connection() was copied to
stats_callback() (i should probably factor out some of the code here!)
with the change that instead of sending stats to a socket, it sends the
event to a callback function.


2002-02-04 07:08:52  Rev 3024   jack

	* src/format_vorbis.c src/format.h src/stats.c src/source.c 
	  src/format.c:
	  Two things:

1) vorbis tags (ARTIST and TITLE) now appear in the stats.  Oddsock did
the first cut of this.

2) stats bug fixed.  if a stats value was NULL a segfault occurred.
strdup(NULL) is fun!


2002-01-21 04:28:30  Rev 2968   jack

	* src/config.h src/source.c src/config.c conf/icecast.xml:
	  Add a source-timeout config option and implement it.  This prevents lame
sources from sticking around way too long.  Default is 10 seconds.


2002-01-21 03:56:16  Rev 2967   jack

2002-01-21 03:10:37  Rev 2966   jack

	* src/connection.c:
	  Fix a stupid but that Oddsock and Ciaran both found.  When sources log in
we weren't checking to see if the mountpoint was already taken.  Since
the mountpoint was the key in the avl tree, bad things happened.


2002-01-05 00:29:27  Rev 2946   jack

	* src/format_vorbis.c src/format.h src/source.c:
	  Thanks to Ciaran for realizing that we werne't freeing the format plugins
memory on source exits.  This caused a small but noticable memory leak.

The fix was to add a new method to the format_plugin object -
free_plugin() - and have the source thread call this on shutdown.


2001-10-29 15:53:28  Rev 2273   jack

	* configure.in:
	  Another fix. -mv8 is a Sparc-only option, and gcc will barf if you use it
on x86.


2001-10-29 15:32:39  Rev 2271   jack

	* configure.in:
	  One more try at this.


2001-10-29 15:02:54  Rev 2269   jack

	* configure.in:
	  Does this fix x86 Solaris?


2001-10-29 14:55:08  Rev 2266   jack

	* configure.in:
	  Fix SUN_LIBS to apply to x86 Solaris boxen.  Who knew someone
actually used x86 Solaris :)


2001-10-21 16:13:02  Rev 2238   jack

	* configure.in Makefile.am src/Makefile.am:
	  Fix broken CFLAGS handling.


2001-10-21 15:25:45  Rev 2235   jack

	* configure.in src/Makefile.am:
	  Fix lib handling.


2001-10-21 15:12:23  Rev 2233   jack

	* configure.in:
	  AC_CHECK_FUNC is stupid.  It needs the LIBS set already, and you can't pass
in a set of libs to use.  So we save/restore for the call.


2001-10-21 14:19:39  Rev 2229   jack

	* configure.in:
	  A few configure.in fixes.

* -D_REENTRANT probably needed on all platforms.  Let's not limit it to
  Linux and Solaris.

* AM_PATH_OGG|VORBIS had a slight bug.  We shouldn't update the LIBS until
  after we've detected anything.  Thanks to Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>
  for finding this.


2001-10-21 10:07:51  Rev 2225   msmith

	* configure.in src/source.c:
	  configure.in: solaris requires -D_REENTRANT. What about other platforms?
source.c: fix bug in handling non-fatal errors like EAGAIN


2001-10-21 02:06:08  Rev 2223   jack

	* src/stats.c src/connection.c src/global.h:
	  Revert stacksize stuff and changes for the thread module.


2001-10-20 22:48:29  Rev 2221   jack

	* src/stats.c src/connection.c src/global.h:
	  Fix icecast for changes in thread module regarding stacksize.  For icecast,
the default stacksize is unchanged (8k) until further testing on Solaris
to determine if a larger value is needed.


2001-10-20 21:29:16  Rev 2207   jack

	* src/Makefile.am:
	  Forgot to add new compat.h to Makefile.am.  Fixed.


2001-10-20 21:28:09  Rev 2206   jack

	* configure.in src/connection.h src/compat.h:
	  Add check for stdint.h, since Solaris doesn't have it.  This is needed
on Linux for uint64_t, but Solaris defines this in sys/types.h.  Use check
where appropriate, and also add typedefs for Win32.


2001-10-20 07:59:01  Rev 2198   jack

	* TODO:
	  Updated the TODO file.


2001-10-20 07:40:09  Rev 2197   jack

	* src/connection.c:
	  Thanks to Akos Maroy <darkeye@tyrell.hu> for this.  These variables need to
be uppercase always in order to comply with the HTTP specification.
While not a problem internal to icecast, they were slipping into the log
files and breaking some less-than-robust parsers.


2001-10-20 06:51:29  Rev 2196   jack

	* src/stats.c src/connection.h src/main.c:
	  It's too bad we don't have a commit script that smacks me upside the head
when I do stupid things like this.


2001-10-20 06:43:04  Rev 2195   jack

	* src/util.c src/stats.c src/connection.c src/source.c 
	  src/connection.h src/main.c src/config.c src/logging.c src/format.c:
	  Win32 fixes.  Look how portable this was ;)  Just header stuff and some defines.
Whee!


2001-09-10 03:26:04  Rev 2012   jack

	* HACKING:
	  Add HACKING file for instructions for building from CVS.
