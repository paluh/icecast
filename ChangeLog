	* also factored out some logic in source_main into common functions

	* updates to libshout)

	* Lots of fixes for screwy code formatting, plus:

	* make streams public by default, send ice-private: 1 to make them private.
	* However, default config file has yp servers commented out.

	* A little fix for compilation on some solaris systems

	* Redo some config file stuff: now all the passwords are inside an element
	* <authentication>, (though for now they're also accepted in the old location),
	* and added admin username and password. Move some of the admin activities over

	   there is no content-type at all.
	 - format_vorbis now handles pages with granulepos of -1 in the headers

	 - buffer overflow in httpp.c fixed.
