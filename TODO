BUGS
----
- stats get off?  this needs testing more testing.

- autoconf doesn't set HAVE_POLL 

- some stuff (like 'genre') isn't making it into the stats dump

- make install - doesn't install configs?

- pthread/bsd: -pthread instead of -lpthread (autoconf)

FEATURES
--------

- pull out vorbis comments.  and send to stats. This seems to be being
  done, but it isn't working right.

- directory server GUID checks
	directory server does GET /GUID-asldjfasldfjalsdkfjasldkfj HTTP/1.0
	and either gets a 404 if it's wrong, or a 200 if it's correct.

- adding new stats type, event.  events don't modify the global stats tree,
	ie, source /1234.ogg disconnected

- support W3C Extended Logging (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html)
	toggle between this and Apache Combined Log Format in the config file.
	default to apache style.

- allow using get_predata() stuff to send an "intro" to any newly-connected
  user?

- stats to list currently connected clients: ip and hostname

- stream switching (drop clients to another stream on disconnect of source)
  - a) fallbacks from named location to new mountpoint
  - OR b) fallbacks for connected clients to new mountpoint (so newly-connecting
       clients just get a 404 on the old path)
  - OR c) combination - first one, plus generic alias ability?

- /admin/* for all admin functionality
  - configuring fallbacks
  - mp3 metadata injection
  - remote shutdown?

- general registerable url-handlers in connection.c rather than hard-coded list
  (already getting unmaintainable)

- httpp - split out query string for further processing

- finish mp3 metadata: http://server:ip/admin.cgi?pass=%s&mode=updinfo&mount=%s&song=%s
