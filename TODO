BUGS
----
- stats get off?  this needs testing more testing.

- autoconf doesn't set HAS_POLL 

- automake isn't installing things (conf, web) correctly.


FEATURES
--------
- pull out vorbis comments.  and send to stats.

- directory server GUID checks
	directory server does GET /GUID-asldjfasldfjalsdkfjasldkfj HTTP/1.0
	and either gets a 404 if it's wrong, or a 200 if it's correct.

- adding new stats type, event.  events don't modify the global stats tree,
	ie, source /1234.ogg disconnected

- support W3C Extended Logging (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html)
	toggle between this and Apache Combined Log Format in the config file.
	default to apache style.

- allow using get_predata() stuff to send an "intro" to any newly-connected
  user?
