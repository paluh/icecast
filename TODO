BUGS
----
- stats get off?  this needs testing more testing.

- seem to be some segfaults in httpp still.  in a few of the cores i've
	been sent, the avl_tree is null when calling into the avl module.

- ensure we don't connect a source if the fd would be more then FD_SETSIZE
  (1024, on linux). Otherwise memory gets overrun, and crashes result. 
  Preferably allow using poll() instead of select() through a lightweight
  abstraction.




FEATURES
--------
- pull out vorbis comments.  and send to stats.

- directory server GUID checks
	directory server does GET /GUID-asldjfasldfjalsdkfjasldkfj HTTP/1.0
	and either gets a 404 if it's wrong, or a 200 if it's correct.

- adding new stats type, event.  events don't modify the global stats tree,
	ie, source /1234.ogg disconnected

- support W3C Extended Logging (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html)
	toggle between this and Apache Combined Log Format in the config file.
	default to apache style.
