Icecast2 alpha 1.

This is an alpha release. Not all functionality is fully implemented, though
we believe it to be very stable for all the currently available features.

It is known to build on linux and win32, and should be easily ported to other
unix platforms (we expect this will require some autoconf work, though).

Run
   ./configure
   make
   make install

To build and install this release.

Documentation is mostly missing at this point. The example config file should
explain most of the features available (but note that the directory services
are not yet available). 

Please email us at icecast@xiph.org or icecast-dev@xiph.org, or come and see
us at irc.xiph.org, channel #icecast (or irc.openprojects.net, #icecast, though
we're not always there) if you have any troubles.
