icecast 2.x - README
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg 
Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet 
radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in 
between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added 
relatively easily and supports open standards for commuincation and 
interaction.
